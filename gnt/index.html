<h3> Notice of Pending End of Availability </h3>
<p>
The Support Staff here have kept the software associated with these
web pages running, through various hardware and
software upgrades, in honour of Tony's memory since his death in 2000.
However, we have reached the point where we can no longer
guarantee to maintain this service - as such we are advising users that
it could disappear at any time.
<p>Update March 2015 - the service is currently not working; we will look at bringing it up again,
but make no guarantees.
<p>
For anyone who would like a copy of the software to install on their
own Web server, a version can be downloaded as a
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/gnt/gnt.tar.gz"> zipped
tarfile</a>.  This tarball dates from 2005, and is based on 
Slackware 10 Linux
using the 2.6 kernel, so if you intend to try to install it under
a more recent version of Slackware, or under some othe operating system,
you will have to be prepared to undertake some porting work.
Unfortunately, we are unable to offer assistance or advice with this,
but Jonathan Kimmit has set up
a A <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/biblestudies">
Yahoo! group</a> to act as as forum in which those who encounter
difficulties with porting the software can assist one another.
<p>
We believe that various other resources, similar in nature, are
now available - the 
<A HREF="http://www.bible-researcher.com/links03.html">
Bible Research</A> Web site contains links to a number of these.

<h3> Introduction </h3>

This is a browsable, Web-based interface to the Greek New Testament (GNT).
It has several distinguishing features. <p>

<ul>
   <li> Unlike packages such as ``Logos'', you don't need to install it:
	if you are reading this page using any graphical web browser (e.g. Netscape or Internet Explorer),
	you can browse the GNT. <p>

   <li> You don't need any Greek fonts.	 The text is rendered as images (GIF files), normally one
	for each verse.	 This gives you good-quality text - much better than several widely-used
	installable fonts - with no effort on your part. <p>

   <li> Subject to the limitations imposed by limited bandwidth, the system is fast.
	Several levels of cacheing are employed, on both server and client.
	Consequently, in most circumstances only a few kilobytes of data need to be transferred for each request.
	The worst case is requesting a complete chapter
	for the first time (e.g. John 1 is sent as a 110 kbyte data stream),
	but even this causes only a short delay in most cases.	Because of the cacheing, speed tends
	to increase as you use the system. <p>

   <li> The system does not use JavaScript, Java, client-side image maps, or any other recent
	enhancement to HTML or browser technology.  I'm by no means averse to using new features -
	I'm not a ``technophobe'' - but there are severe and often unacknowledged problems of
	incompatibility and inefficiency which I wanted especially to avoid in this project.
	For example, client-side image maps would seem to be ideal for implementing selection;
	but this feature proved to be unacceptably slow, at any rate on the browser on which I tested it. <p>

   <li> There is a search facility.  You can search for a given word; for a word occurring close to
	another given word; for a word with a given root (base or lemma);
	and you can limit the search by grammatical category.  Examples: <p>

	<ul>
	   <li> Find all perfect imperatives.  (There are 4 of them.)
	   <li> Find all plural forms of a particular word.
	</ul>

	<p> The search facility is fast, simple and self-explanatory. <p>

   <li> You specify Greek input by typing a Latin transliteration on the
	keyboard; e.g. <i>kalos</i> for ... sorry, I can't display that in Greek here!
	The Latin-to-Greek transliteration is simple;
	it's based on that used by the ``<a href=//www.perseus.tufts.edu>Perseus</a>'' system,
	but is slightly more forgiving of mis-spellings.
	The transliteration is defined <a href=trlit.html>here</a>. <p>
</ul>

<h3> Caveat </h3>

I am a student of New Testament Greek.	I am in no sense an expert.
I wrote the programs which implement the interface in order to
learn NT Greek better. <p>

The system is in its early stages, and it has a few deficiencies of which I am aware
(and, no doubt, many more which are obvious to you, the reader). <p>

<h3> Instructions </h3

The whole system is supposed to be self-explanatory, but there are some aspects
of operation which might not be obvious. <p>

To start, press one or other of the
buttons at the top of this page, and follow the instructions from there. <p>

<b>If you click on a Greek word, it will turn red and a table will appear,</b>
giving information about the word, including its root and grammatical category. <p>

<ul> <small>
   (If you are using Netscape, the table will appear near the top of the window.
   When using Internet Explorer, for some reason the automatic positioning doesn't work,
   and you have to scroll down to the selected word yourself.)
</small> </ul>

At the moment, an English translation is not given.
I am in two minds about providing this facility; it might hinder, rather than enhance,
the learning of the vocabulary. <p>
